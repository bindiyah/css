<p><strong>    Our work is about the relationship between people and places. We specialise in research and community projects exploring how people are affected by changes in the built environment.
    Social Life is a social enterprise,to become a specialist centre of research and innovation about the social life of communities.Our work is about understanding how peoples' day-to-day experience of local places is shaped by the built environment - housing, public spaces, parks and local high streets - and how change, through regeneration, new development or small improvements to public spaces, affects the social fabric, opportunities and wellbeing of local areas.
 We bring these insights to the process of planning, designing and managing places by working with communities, built environment professionals, public agencies and governments, in the India and internationally.
